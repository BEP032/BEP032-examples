ses-PeterMS12170712101120concat	96.0	Petersen et al. demonstrate that cooling of the medial septum slows theta oscillation and increases choice errors without affecting spatial features of pyramidal neurons. Cooling affects distance-time, but not distance-theta phase, compression. The findings reveal that cell assemblies are organized by theta phase and not by external (clock) time.
